  "The end goal for pedantic is to hook into Aether's dependency
resolution and provide feedback about the dependency tree. Using a
`DependencyGraphTransformer` allows us to look at the tree both before
and after conflict resolution so that downloading all of the
dependencies only occurs once.

Aether uses a `NearestVersionConflictResolver` to resolve which
versions to use in case of a conflict. The
`NearestVersionConflictResolver` uses a `ConflictIdSorter` to
determine those, and it will save the information in
`SORTED_CONFLICT_IDS` and `CONFLICT_IDS`. We can similarly use the
conflict information to determine which version is choosen in a
conflict.

Additional important classes from Aether:

* `DependencyGraphTransformationContext`
* `DependencyNode`
* `Dependency`
* `Artifact`
* `Version`
* `VersionConstraint`"

`ranges` and `overrides` are expect to be (atom []).  This provides a way to
send back information since the return value can't be used here.

After resolution:
  `ranges` will be a vector of paths (see pedantic.path)
  `overrides` will be a vector of maps with keys [:accepted :ignoreds :ranges].
    `:accepted` is the path that was resolved. :ignored is a list of
